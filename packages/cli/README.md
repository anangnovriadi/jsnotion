# jsnotion

![npm](https://img.shields.io/npm/dm/jsnotion)

A code documenting application that can 10x your productivity while learning to code.

## Installation

Assuming you have Node and npm installed,

```
npx jsnotion serve
```

is the only command you need to get started instantly.

Otherwise, if you are a visionary and you see yourself using it frequently,

```
npm install -g jsnotion
```

this will install jsnotion globally so that you can use it anytime you like, from the terminal.

Now, more on the commands:-

```
jsnotion serve
```

This is your goto command which will start a server at http://localhost:3005 and create/open a notebook.js file in your current directory to save all your notes.

```
jsnotion serve notes.js -p 4000
```

This is a more personalized command you can use to create/open a file of your choice, in this case, notes.js and also the port of your choice i.e, 4000 here.

## Usage

While this is a short preview of the application, in no way it shows all the capabilities of jsnotion. You can import anything (just about anything) and run it in your editor. Some examples include - making axios calls, importing CSS libraries, etc. React is prebuilt and you can use the `show()` function to display anything in your preview window.
